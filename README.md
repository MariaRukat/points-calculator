# Points Calcutator

We've migrated our docs to [https://oss.warsawlo.pl](https://oss.warsawlo.pl/docs/packages/overview).

### Warning!
There are some key differences between the last and current version of the package.
If you don't migrate to the latest version, your code won't work properly.

**Version 1.0.2 is deprecated. Use that version only if you want to support `secondarySchool` mode.**
